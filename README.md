Project Details
Project Name: FreshBasket
Purpose: Develop a fully functional online grocery delivery platform

Target Audience: Customers who prefer to order groceries online for convenient home delivery
Story Behind the Project
As a child, I vividly remember accompanying my mother to the local grocery market and spending hours selecting fresh produce and groceries. However, with the rise of technology and the convenience it brings, I realized the need for an online grocery delivery platform. This project resonated with me personally as I wanted to recreate the seamless experience of browsing and purchasing groceries from the comfort of one’s home.

Setting Up the Project
Cloning the FreshBasket Repository
To get started, clone the "FreshBasket" repository from GitHub. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to set up the project. Then, run the following command:

$ git clone https://github.com/bharath/FreshBasket.git
This will create a new directory called "FreshBasket" containing the project files.

Creating a Virtual Environment Navigate into the "FreshBasket" directory and create a virtual environment for the project. Run the following commands:
$ cd FreshBasket
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
This will create a new virtual environment and activate it.

Installing Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, let’s install the required dependencies. Run the following command:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the necessary packages specified in the "requirements.txt" file.

Configuring the Database
The "FreshBasket" project uses MySQL as the database. Before running the application, you need to set up a MySQL database and configure the project to use it.

a. Creating a MySQL Database

Open your preferred MySQL client and create a new database for the project. You can use the following SQL command:

CREATE DATABASE freshbasket;
b. Configuring the Database Connection

In the project directory, open the "config.py" file. Update the values of the following variables with your MySQL database credentials:

DB_HOST = 'localhost'
DB_USER = 'your_mysql_username'
DB_PASSWORD = 'your_mysql_password'
DB_NAME = 'freshbasket'
Save the changes.

Running the Application
To start the FreshBasket web application, run the following command:

$ python app.py
This will launch the application, and you can access it by opening your web browser and entering the URL http://localhost:5000.
